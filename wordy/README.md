# Wordy

Write a program that takes a word problem and returns the answer as an integer.

## Step 1

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

The program should handle large numbers and negative numbers.

Remember, that these are verbal word problems, not treated as you
normally would treat a written problem.  This means that you calculate
as you move forward each step.  3 + 2 * 3 = 15, not 18.

Use the tests to drive your solution by deleting the `skip` in one test
at a time.

## Step 2

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

## Step 3

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

> What is 7 minus 5 minus 1?

> What is 9 minus 3 plus 5?

> What is 3 plus 5 minus 8?

## Step 4

E.g.

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 times 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

> What is 78 plus 5 minus 3?

> What is 18 times 3 plus 16?

> What is 4 times 3 divided by 6?

> What is 4 plus 3 times 2?

## Extensions

Implement questions of the type:

> What is 2 raised to the 5th power?

Remember to write failing tests for this code.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-ruby.html).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for runnng
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -rminitest/pride hello_world_test.rb

The test files may have the execution bit set so you may also be able to
run it like this:

    ./hello_world_test.rb
