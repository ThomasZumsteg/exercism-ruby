# Space Age

Write a program that, given an age in seconds, calculates how old someone is in terms of a given planet's solar years.

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

   - Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
   - Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
   - Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
   - Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
   - Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
   - Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
   - Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
   - Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should
be able to say that they're 31 Earth-years old.

Refer exercism help page at http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-ruby.html for ruby installation and learning resources.

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called `hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb
