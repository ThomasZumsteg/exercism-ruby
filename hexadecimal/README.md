# Hexadecimal

Write a program that will convert a hexadecimal number, represented as a string (e.g. "10af8c"), to its decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in ruby libraries or gems to accomplish the conversion).

On the web we use hexadecimal to represent colors, e.g. green: 008000,
teal: 008080, navy: 000080).

The program should handle invalid hexadecimal strings.

Refer exercism help page at http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-ruby.html for ruby installation and learning resources.

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called `hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb
