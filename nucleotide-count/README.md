# Nucleotide Count

Given a DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C',
'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the
particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
- amino acids are to proteins as
- sugar is to starch as
- oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to nucleotides.

DNA contains four types of them: adenine (`A`), cytosine (`C`), guanine
(`G`), and thymine (`T`).

RNA contains a slightly different set of nucleotides, but we don't care
about that for now.

Refer exercism help page at http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-ruby.html for ruby installation and learning resources.

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called `hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb
