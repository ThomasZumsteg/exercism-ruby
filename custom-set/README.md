# Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for runnng
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -rminitest/pride hello_world_test.rb

The test files may have the execution bit set so you may also be able to
run it like this:

    ./hello_world_test.rb
